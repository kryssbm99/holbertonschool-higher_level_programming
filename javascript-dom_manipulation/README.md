# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

This project focuses on manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. It includes various scripts that demonstrate how to interact with and modify HTML elements dynamically.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `0-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that changes the header color to red.
- `0-script.js`: JavaScript file that changes the header color to red when the page loads.
- `1-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that changes the header color to red when clicking a div.
- `1-script.js`: JavaScript file that changes the header color to red when the user clicks on the div.
- `2-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that adds a class to the header.
- `2-script.js`: JavaScript file that adds the class 'red' to the header when clicking a div.
- `3-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that toggles classes on the header.
- `3-script.js`: JavaScript file that toggles the classes 'red' and 'green' on the header when clicking a div.
- `4-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that adds a new list item.
- `4-script.js`: JavaScript file that adds a new list item to the unordered list when clicking a div.
- `5-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that updates the header text.
- `5-script.js`: JavaScript file that updates the header text to 'New Header!!!' when clicking a div.
- `6-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that fetches and displays a character name.
- `6-script.js`: JavaScript file that fetches the name of a Star Wars character from an API and displays it.
- `7-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that fetches and displays movie titles.
- `7-script.js`: JavaScript file that fetches and lists all Star Wars movie titles.
- `8-main.html`: HTML file to test the script that fetches and displays a translated hello.
- `8-script.js`: JavaScript file that fetches and displays the translation of "hello" from an API.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
